# odin-recipes

I created a HTML only recipe website that links to multiple recipes.

## Languages used:
* HTML
* CSS

## Tools Used:
* Visual Studio Code
* Firefox Dev Tools
* Chrome Dev Tools
* Favicon.cc

## Disclaimer:
I've added some css to make it look more appealing to the eyes. Also designed the look of the website according to a design style called "brutalist web design".
