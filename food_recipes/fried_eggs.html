    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Over medium eggs are just like over easy eggs, except the yolk cooks longer until it is partially set, but still creamy. <br>
        A great over medium egg will have a jammy yolk that is neither runny nor completely set.</p>

        <br>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> 1 or more freerange eggs</li>

            <li> Table spoon of olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a non-stick or a cast iron skillet over medium heat with 1 tablespoon cooking oil until the oil starts to shimmer. <br>
                If using butter, wait until it stops sizzling, but before it starts to turn brown.</li>
            <li>Add the egg to the skillet.</li> 
            <li>When the whites are firm and the bottom of the yolk is set, after 2 to 3 minutes, <br>
                use a large spatula to flip it, turning the egg gently, so the yolk doesn't break.</li>
            <li>Cook for 60 to 90 seconds more and serve with the flipped side up, then season to taste.</li>
        </ol>
